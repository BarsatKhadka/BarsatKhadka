        Growing up in Nepal shaped my belief in open source as a way to expand access to knowledge. It's why I'm so invested in projects like <strong>Vinaya</strong> and exploring the <strong>OpenLane 2</strong> ecosystem. I believe that open source isn't just a way to build software; it's a way to level the playing field.

        I've always had the vision of being a scientist, and I love doing research for the sake of science and the craft. Most of my time is spent between research papers, quiet work, music, commute to university, meetings, cooking, and gaming.
